# Weather-Tracker
An application, themed by the movie "Weathering with you" that permits you to track in real time weathers around the world!

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You will need to have Node.js installed. <br />
You will need to have create-react-app installed. <br />
You will need to disable web security disabled on your browser<br />

### Installing
In your terminal, go to wherever you would like to put the app using: <br />
```
cd "destination"
```
Then enter: <br />
```
npm create-react-app "folder name"
```
Go into the folder you just created and there should be a src folder. Replace all of its contents by the files above. <br />
Go back to your terminal and enter the following to open the application on your browser: <br />
```
npm start
```

## Improvements
The page gives back an error page if an invalid city or country is inputed. I'll try to implement a feature that simply returns an error message.
